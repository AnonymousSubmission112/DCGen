      <h2>What's lencr.org?</h2>
      <p>lencr.org is a domain name owned by Let's Encrypt. We use it to host data that is referenced inside the certificates we issue.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why is my computer fetching this data? Is it malicious?</h2>
      <p>No, the data on lencr.org is never malicious. When a device connects to lencr.org, it's because client software on that device (like a web browser or an app) connected to another site, saw a Let's Encrypt certificate, and is trying to verify that it's valid. This is routine for many clients.</p>
      <p>We can't speak to whether the other site being connected to is malicious. If you're investigating network activity that seems unusual, then you may want to focus on the connection that started just before the connection to lencr.org.</p>
      <p>The pattern of client connections to lencr.org might look unusual or intermittent. Clients might never retrieve this data, only retrieve subsets of it, or "cache" some data for efficiency, so they'll only access it sometimes (the first time they need it, and when the data may have expired).</p>
