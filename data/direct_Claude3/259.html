      <h2>What is GNU?</h2>
      <p>GNU is a recurring acronym for "GNU's Not Unix", a computer operating system composed entirely of free software. The GNU operating system is a complete free software which can be run on computers, ensuring that the computer user retains the freedom to share and modify that software.</p>
      <p>The development of the GNU operating system was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, with the intention of having a free software operating system, compatible with Unix. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs included in the system) and non-GNU programs which are also free software.</p>

      <h2>What is the Free Software Movement?</h2>
      <p>The Free Software movement campaigns to make computer users free to study, copy, modify and redistribute software. The philosophy behind this movement rejects the principle of proprietary software, saying that for propriety programs, the developers prevent the users from modifying the software and this restricts their freedoms.</p>

      <h2>What is Free Software?</h2>
      <p>Free software means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
        <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.</li>
        <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
        <li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A program is free software if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is proprietary, or non-free. While non-free software isn't illegal, we aim to make it socially inacceptable.</p>

      <h2>More about GNU</h2>
      <p>GNU's design is Unix-like, although such similarities are due to requirement adherence rather than code being adopted from that pre-existing system. The development of GNU was initiated by Richard Stallman while he was an employee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1983. The name "GNU" is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix".</p>
      <p>The core of the GNU operating system is named the GNU/Linux, which is an operating system as a whole; the program in a traditional Unix-like system uses GNU core components along with the Linux operating system kernel and an alternative kernel such as GNU Hurd, the official GNU kernel released in 1996.</p>
