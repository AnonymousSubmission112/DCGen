        <h1>UNPKG</h1>
        <p>unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm. Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL.</p>
        <p>unpkg.com/package@version/file</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Using a fixed version:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js</li>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also use a semver range or a tag instead of a fixed version number, or omit the version to get the latest version (but be careful, as the latest version may change over time):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react@^17/umd/react.production.min.js</li>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you omit the file path (or use it blank), unpkg will serve the file specified by the unpkg field in the package.json, or the main file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- unpkg.com/jquery</li>
            <li>- unpkg.com/jquery/</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Append a / at the end of a URL to view a listing of all the files in a package:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react/</li>
            <li>- unpkg.com/react-router/</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Query Parameters</h2>
        <p>?meta</p>
        <p>Return metadata about any file in a package as JSON (eg. /any/file?meta).</p>
        <p>?module</p>
        <p>Expand all "bare" import specifiers to autoimport modules to unpkg URLs. This feature is very experimental.</p>

        <h2>Cache Behavior</h2>
        <p>The CDN caches files based on their permalink URL, which includes the npm package version. This works because npm does not allow package authors to overwrite a package that has already been published with a different one at the same version number.</p>
        <p>Browsers are instructed via the Cache-Control header to cache assets indefinitely (1 year).</p>
        <p>URLs that contain a version number will be cached indefinitely (unless the latest version where no version is specified, or the @next tag version where a next version is being developed). Headers are cached for 10 minutes at the CDN, 1 minute in browsers.</p>
        <p>If you want users to be able to get the latest version when you cut a new release, the best policy is to let your application dynamically request the new distribution via unpkg.com/package@latest. This will also avoid more quickly because we won't have to reindex the latest version and redirect them.</p>

        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>For npm package authors, unpkg offloads the burden of publishing your code to a CDN or addition to the npm registry. All you need to do is include your script, build at a particular path in your repo, and it's available via unpkg:</p>
        <p>You can do this easily using the following setup:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Add the umd (or dist) directory to your .gitignore file</li>
            <li>- Add the umd directory to your file: main in package.json</li>
            <li>- Use a build script to generate your UMD build in the umd directory when you publish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's it! Now when you npm publish, you'll have a publicly-available URL to link to as well.</p>
