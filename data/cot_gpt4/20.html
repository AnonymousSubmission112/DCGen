<h1>Control Over Your Personal Information</h1>
<p>By following the instructions below, you may request The Trade Desk limit (a) use of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes and (b) sale or sharing of your personal information.</p>
<p>In response to browser and device providers changing their support for identifiers currently used for advertising, such as third-party cookies and device ids, it may be possible that you have more than one identifier associated with each browser or device.

<h2>Cookie Based Opt-Out</h2>
<p>Some things to keep in mind when using the cookie opt-out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use more than one computer, browser or browser profile, you will need to opt-out of all cookies on every browser you use.</li>
<li>If you clear or delete your cookies, this will result in the deletion of your Trade Desk opt-out cookie, meaning you will need to reset the opt-out following the deletion</li>
<li>Even after opting out, you may continue to receive advertising through our services, but these ads may be less relevant to you. After you opt out, your browser's Trade Desk advertising cookie will be set as a zeroes meaning your Trade Desk Browser cookie will no longer allow us to target advertising to your interests based on this cookie</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if you block or otherwise restrict cookies this can affect choices, such as The Trade Desk opt out, that are reliant on such cookies.</p>
